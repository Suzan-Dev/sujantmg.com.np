## About me 👋

Hi! I'm **Sujan Tamang**, a self-taught software developer with over 3+ year of experience.
I have a flair for creating elegant solutions and building better applications for the world.

Passionate about **Web development** & **Open source**.
**Javascript** being my core technical skill, there's no limit for my interest of learning new technologies.

Started my journey as a **Frontend React.js Developer** to **Backend Node.js Developer**, currently I'm
working as a **Full Stack Javascript Developer** at [Botsplash](https://www.botsplash.com).
I've worked on two biggest **E-commerce projects**, [**Test Case Management Software**](https://app.testmink.com)
and numerous [**side projects**](https://github.com/Suzan-Dev?tab=repositories) of my own.
I love being a part of the tech communities, learn new technologies, solve problems & write clean code.

I hope you'll enjoy reading the blog. Have a great day!
