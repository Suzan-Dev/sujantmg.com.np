![Why Listing Dependencies in package.json is a Good Practice](/static/images/blogs/14/banner.jpg)

It's my first tech article of 2023 and I hope everyone is having a great year. This article is all about _managing dependencies_ in Nodejs.
I know sometimes it can feel like _spider's web_ (like the picture above) and only small amount of time is spent managing it but
still understanding it is very crutial. Today, I want to share something that I just recently faced at my work.

## A Short Story

One day, I was upgrading a npm library to it's latest version. I looked at it's migration guide and found no breaking changes for our project.
It was a necessary upgrade so, I just ran some commands, upgraded it and pushed the code. Later, the **system crashed** due to the code I pushed.
I was amazed by the error message because it was of another library that I didn't even touch. so, I was asking myself why the hell did that happen.

If something like this has already happened to you before and you've solved it, still you can read this article to the end because
I'm going to cover some extra things. Let's get started.

## Prerequisites

This is not a step-by-step tutorial and I'm assuming that you are already familiar with Node.js & Package management.
I'm going to write some simple commands & little amount of code. If you want, you can follow along me.
But if you just want to get the idea, please skip the next section.

## Recreating the error

I'm going to install some npm libraries. You don't have to know about them. It's just for **demonstration purpose**.
If you're going to follow along, you'll need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
I'm going to use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) but you can use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) instead if you like.

Create a new folder and inside it run the following command:

```
$ npm init -y
```

This will create a new file named `package.json`.
Now install a library called [firebase-admin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase-admin) with version 8.0.0.

```
$ npm i firebase-admin@8.0.0
```

We're installing v8.0.0 so, that later we can simulate the error that I got while upgrading the package.
Inside the folder create a new file named `index.js`.

```
$ touch index.js
```

Inside the file, add the following lines of code.

```js:index.js
const uuid = require('uuid/v4')

console.log('Result: ' + uuid())
```

We haven't installed any library named [uuid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) but how are we able to use it?
It's possible because `firebase-admin` is using `uuid` as a dependency so, it got installed alongside and
we're able to use `firebase-admin` library's dependencies directly in our code without having it in our `package.json`.

> This is not a good practice and can produce unexpected error later on which I'm going to show.

Let's get the `uuid` library's version that got installed by going into the `node_modules` folder. Inside it, look for a folder named `uuid`
and inside that folder is another `package.json` file which is of `uuid` library. Remember the version for now which is **"3.4.0"**.

Now let's run the file using the following command:

```
$ node index
```

It shoud log something like below to the console.

```
Result: 608bf07c-8af6-42a5-b8b5-50f0005f2de5
```

Okay, till now everything is fine. Now we're going to upgrade the `firebase-admin` to latest and face the same error I faced at my work.

```
$ npm i firebase-admin@11.5.0
```

> instead of @11.5.0, you can use @latest but for now I recommend you to use @11.5.0 to follow along the article.

Now, try to run the file again and this time you will get an error something like this.

```
$ node index
node:internal/modules/cjs/loader:535
      throw e;
      ^

Error [ERR_PACKAGE_PATH_NOT_EXPORTED]: Package subpath './v4' is not defined by "exports" in ...
```

The error is not coming from `firebase-admin` library that we upgraded. It's actually coming from `uuid` library.
I will explain later on but for now, let's fix this error by updating the code.

```js:index.js
const { v4: uuidv4 } = require('uuid')

console.log('Result: ' + uuidv4())
```

If you now run the file, it will work like before. What just happened?
I was also shocked for the first time I faced this. Let's get to the answer.

## Analyzing the whole process

So, error appeared for `uuid` library after upgrading `firebase-admin` to latest.
It's becuase the latest version of this library is using different version of `uuid` library.
When we upgraded `firebase-admin` library, it's dependencies also got upgraded.

Let's verify this by again looking into `uuid` folder inside `node_modules`.
If you now see the version inside `package.json` file, it should be "9.0.0" but before it was "3.4.0".

In v9.0.0 of `uuid` library, the previous syntax won't work so, we updated the code to fix the error.
We'll never want something like this to happen in the future again while upgrading libraries. so, let's get to the solution.

## Solution

As might you've guessed, we shouldn't use `firebase-admin` library's `uuid` dependency.
If you've installed the `uuid` library in your project this error might not have occured.
so, it's a good practice to install the library that you're using directly in your project.
(i.e. make sure it is listed in your project's `package.json` file)

If you follow the same process by installing `uuid` library before upgrading `firebase-admin`,
it would work without any errors and you can upgrade `uuid` library whenever you want.

Sometimes, we might **forgot** to install them because when we use libraries like that, no error is thrown.
For time like this, you can use a tool that'll check your `package.json` file with the
libraries that you're using in your project and let you know of missing dependencies.

There are a lot of libraries for this. One of them is [depcheck](https://www.npmjs.com/package/depcheck).
It not only shows the missing dependencies from `package.json` but also how each dependencies are being used and
which dependencies are useless (i.e. not used).

If you install and run `depcheck` then it'll output something like

```
Unused dependencies
* firebase-admin
Missing dependencies
* uuid: .\index.js
```

That's it. Now you know your unused and missing dependencies and act on them accordingly.

## Pnpm - An alternative solution

[Pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) a is fast, disk space efficient package manager. How can this new thing become a solution?
A little time back, I said _"Sometimes, we might forgot to install them because when we use libraries like that, no error is thrown."_
But let me tell you this, If you use `pnpm` as your package manager instead of `npm` or `yarn`, it'll throw an error. But how and why?

In short, it has **non-flat node_modules directory** which is very different than others.
When installing dependencies with `npm` or `yarn`, all packages are hoisted to the root of the modules directory.
(i.e. they'll have **flat node_modules directory**). As a result, source code has access to dependencies that are not added as dependencies to the project.
By default, pnpm uses **symlinks** to add only the direct dependencies of the project into the root of the modules directory.

You can also have **flat node_modules directory** when using pnpm if you want and
make it behave like `npm` or `yarn` with some changes to **hoisting** settings.
You can find it [here](https://pnpm.io/npmrc#dependency-hoisting-settings).

You can easily [transition](https://pnpm.io/cli/import) to pnpm from `npm` or `yarn`. I totally love using it in my projects.
The DX that it provides is great. I'll be writing an article on `pnpm` in the future and cover it in more detail.

## Closing thoughts

I hope this article helped you to know why listing dependencies in package.json file is essential for _efficient_ and _secure_ code management.
This was a new lesson for me too. I hope to share more things like this if I faced them. This much for today and have a nice day.
