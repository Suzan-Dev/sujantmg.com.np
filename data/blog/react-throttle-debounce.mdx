## Overview

When a React component handles bursting events like window resize, scrolling, user typing into an input, etc. — it’s wise to soften the handlers of these events.

Otherwise, when the handlers are invoked too often you risk making the application lagging or even unresponsive for a few seconds. Fortunately, debouncing and throttling techniques can help you control the invocation of the event handlers.

In this post, you’ll learn how to correctly use React hooks to apply debouncing and throttling techniques to callbacks in React.

If you’re unfamiliar with debounce and throttle concepts, I recommend checking [Debouncing and Throttling Explained Through Examples](https://css-tricks.com/debouncing-throttling-explained-examples) or similar posts.

## The callback without debouncing

Let’s say that a component `<FilterList>` accepts a big list of names (at least 200 records). The component has an input field where the user types a query and the names are filtered by that query.

Here’s the first version of `<FilterList>` component:

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react'

export function FilterList({ names }) {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('')

  let filteredNames = names

  if (query !== '') {
    filteredNames = names.filter((name) => {
      return name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
    })
  }

  const changeHandler = (event) => {
    setQuery(event.target.value)
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <input onChange={changeHandler} type="text" placeholder="Type a query..." />
      {filteredNames.map((name) => (
        <div key={name}>{name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

When typing the query into the input field, you can notice that the list gets filtered for every introduced character.

For example, if you type char by char the word `Michael`, then the component would display flashes of filtered lists for the queries `M, Mi, Mic, Mich, Micha, Michae, Michael`. However, the user would need to see just one filter result: for the word `Michael`.

Let’s improve the process of filtering by applying `300ms` time debouncing on the `changeHandler` callback function.

## Debouncing a callback, the first attempt

To debounce the `changeHandler` function I’m going to use the `lodash.debounce` package. You can use any other library at your will, or even write the debounce function by yourself.

First, let’s look at how to use the [debounce()](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#debounce) function:

```jsx
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce'

const debouncedCallback = debounce(callback, waitTime)
```

`debounce()` function accepts the `callback` argument function, and returns a debounced version of that function.

When the debounced function `debouncedCallback` gets invoked multiple times, in bursts, it will invoke the callback only after `waitTime` has passed after the last invocation.

The debouncing fits nicely to soften the filtering inside the `<FilterList>`: let’s debounce `changeHandler` to `300ms` wait time.

The only problem with applying debouncing to `changeHandler` inside a React component is that the debounced version of the function should remain the same between component re-renderings.

The first approach would be to use the `useCallback(callback, dependencies)` that would keep one instance of the debounced function between component re-renderings.

```jsx {2,19,23}
import { useState, useCallback } from 'react'
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce'

export function FilterList({ names }) {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('')

  let filteredNames = names

  if (query !== '') {
    filteredNames = names.filter((name) => {
      return name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
    })
  }

  const changeHandler = (event) => {
    setQuery(event.target.value)
  }

  const debouncedChangeHandler = useCallback(debounce(changeHandler, 300), [])

  return (
    <div>
      <input onChange={debouncedChangeHandler} type="text" placeholder="Type a query..." />
      {filteredNames.map((name) => (
        <div key={name}>{name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

[Try the demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/use-callback-debouncing-0ch2q?file=/src/FilterList.js)

`debounce(changeHandler, 300)` creates a debounced version of the event handled, and `useCallback(debounce(changeHandler, 300), [])` makes sure to return the same instance of the debounced callback between re-renderings.

Note: the approach also works with creating throttled functions, e.g. `useCallback(throttle(callback, time), [])`.

Open the [demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/use-callback-debouncing-0ch2q?file=/src/FilterList.js) and type a query: you’ll see that the list is filtered with a delay of `300ms` after the last typing: which brings a softer and better user experience.

However… this implementation has a small performance issue: each time the component re-renders, a new instance of the debounced function is created by the `debounce(changeHandler, 300)`.

That’s not a problem regarding the correctness: `useCallback()` makes sure to return the same debounced function instance. But it would be wise to avoid calling `debounce(...)` on each rendering.

Let’s see how to avoid creating debounced functions on each render in the next section.

## Debouncing a callback, second attempt

Fortunately, using `useMemo()` hook as an alternative to `useCallback()` is a more optimal choice:

```jsx {19}
import { useState, useMemo } from 'react'
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce'

export function FilterList({ names }) {
  const [query, setQuery] = useState('')

  let filteredNames = names

  if (query !== '') {
    filteredNames = names.filter((name) => {
      return name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
    })
  }

  const changeHandler = (event) => {
    setQuery(event.target.value)
  }

  const debouncedChangeHandler = useMemo(() => debounce(changeHandler, 300), [])

  return (
    <div>
      <input onChange={debouncedChangeHandler} type="text" placeholder="Type a query..." />
      {filteredNames.map((name) => (
        <div key={name}>{name}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

[Try the demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/use-memo-debouncing-jwsog?file=/src/FilterList.js)

`useMemo(() => debounce(changeHandler, 300), [])` memoizes the debounced handler, but also calls `debounce()` only during initial rendering of the component.

This approach also works with creating throttled functions: `useMemo(() => throttle(callback, time), [])`.

If you open the [demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/use-memo-debouncing-jwsog?file=/src/FilterList.js), you’d see that typing into the input field is still debounced.

## Be careful with dependencies

If the debounced handler uses props or state, to avoid creating stale closures, I recommend setting up correctly the dependencies of `useMemo()`:

```jsx {8, 11}
import { useMemo } from 'react'
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce'

function MyComponent({ prop }) {
  const [value, setValue] = useState('')

  const eventHandler = () => {
    // the event uses `prop` and `value`
  }

  const debouncedEventHandler = useMemo(() => debounce(eventHandler, 300), [prop, stateValue])

  // ...
}
```

Properly setting the dependencies guarantees refreshing the debounced closure.

## Cleanup

Because debouncing and throttling execute the function with a delay, you might end up in a situation when the function is executed after the component is unmounted.

When no longer needed, it is recommended to cancel debouncing and throttling.

The debounce and throttle implementations usually provide a special method to cancel the execution. For example `lodash.debounce` library provides `debouncedCallback.cancel()` to cancel any scheduled calls.

Here’s how you can cancel the debounced function when the component unmounts:

```jsx {13-17}
import { useState, useMemo, useEffect } from 'react';
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce';

export function FilterList({ names }) {
  // ....

  const debouncedChangeHandler = useMemo(
    () => debounce(changeHandler, 300)
  , []);

  // Stop the invocation of the debounced function
  // after unmounting
  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      debouncedChangeHandler.cancel();
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    // ....
  );
}
```

## Conclusion

A good way to create debounced and throttled functions, to handle often happening events, is by using the `useMemo()` hook:

```jsx {10,12}
import { useMemo } from 'react'
import debounce from 'lodash.debounce'
import throttle from 'lodash.throttle'

function MyComponent() {
  const eventHandler = () => {
    // handle the event...
  }

  const debouncedEventHandler = useMemo(() => debounce(eventHandler, 300), [])

  const throttledEventHandler = useMemo(() => throttle(eventHandler, 300), [])

  // ...
}
```

If the debounced or throttled event handler accesses props or state values, do not forget to set the dependencies argument of `useMemo(..., dependencies)`.

What events, in your opinion, worth debouncing and throttling?
