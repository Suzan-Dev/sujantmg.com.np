![2022 in Review](/static/images/blogs/13/banner.jpg)

Welcome to 2023 and hope this year will be better than 2022 for everyone.
Today I want to share a review of my 2022, how it went & what new things happened.
Let's jump right into it!

## Joined a new company

Previously I was working for a company named **EKbana Solutions**. I worked there as _Frontend Developer_ for nearly 8 months.
At that time, I felt that I was not growing with the team members and left that job to take some time-off & to learn on my own.
After 5 months, I joined [Botsplash](https://www.botsplash.com) and currently working as a _Full Stack Javascript Developer_
and I'm happy to work on a SaaS product with a great team.

## Why I stopped writing blogs and the future

If you see the previous blog I wrote, it was 10 months ago. When I first started writing blogs, I was very happy to share
my knowledge because I'm also a self-taught developer and learned to code through blogs & videos.
But later, I felt like I was reading others blog and copying many of it to my own blogs.
That was not my actual motive behind to start writing blogs so, I stopped.

But after reading many blogs out there and analyzing it. I feel now that I'm ready to start again.
I'll be writing blogs starting this year.

## What I learned in 2022

In 2022, I learned & experimented with many new things. I continued adopting and learning more **Typescript** and the main highlight
from it is _Generics_. It helped me to reduce my code of types by making it reuseable. I learned more of **React** and
looked into **Solid** and **Remix** but didn't tried to learn any other framework/library. The new React docs is a great place to read about it.

For backend side, I started learning **SQL and PostgreSQL** in more detail because I didn't wanted to be stuck to just _NoSQL Database_.
I also spend countless time reading blogs on **Nodejs** topics that was new and advanced to me like **multithreading, clustering etc**.

**Vite** was a great DX improvement for me. **Data Structures and Algorithms** helped me to think problems in a different way.
**React Query & RTK Query** made me realize how _caching_ can be a great addition to an app. Also, I'm thinking to rewrite this blog in **Astro**.
Those were just the highlights and the list of my learnings are so much more.

## What I'll be learning in 2023

First of all, I'll continue learning **SQL and PostgreSQL** and finish it before anything else.
I'll be learning some **AWS Services** if needed & **Redis** for sure this year.
I've started loving real-time apps so, I would learn **Websockets & Socket.io**.

Others, I think I'll learn more about **microservices** and the technologies around it.
I still have some interest on **Blockchain and animations** so, I could also learn it.
If new technologies pop out, I'll take a look into them like I did for **tRPC**.
Finally, I would create some blogs around all of these topics so, keep an eye out.

## Wrap Up

That's all to say. Happy new year once again and have a great year everyone.
