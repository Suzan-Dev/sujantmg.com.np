## Overview

When I first started learning Javascript, I only know and care about it.
But after some months of learning and getting the grasp of Javascript, I came across **libraries** and **frameworks**.
I didn't know what to choose as learning all at the same time was not possible.
But I was for sure going to learn one of these **three**: [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or [Angular](https://angular.io/).

After researching for few days, I choosed to be a **React Developer**.
It was _hard time_ learning it for the first time. Many people said that **Vue.js** is easy to learn.
I didn't listen to people at that time as the **jobs** for React was popping everywhere.

As expected, I got my **internship** as a React Developer after **a month** of learning React.
Now, After having some good knowledge of React, I wanted to learn a **framework** and choosed to learn **Vue.js** instead of **Angular** for now.
In the future, I might also learn about Angular or other **evolving libraries/frameworks** and will definitely make an article.

And Also, I am tired of the **tech-wars**. I am tired of articles that claim a certain framework would be the best choice.
The articles become most annoying when they make a **silly comparison**. Angular vs. React. React vs. Vue — and so on.
I don’t think there will ever be a **clear winner**. The reason is that all the technologies have **different strengths** — and
the best way to end the tech-wars might be to point out these **strengths**.

Therefore, here are the things what I like about _Vue.js_ — as a **hopefully open-minded** _React.js_ developer. Have fun!

## Getting started is easy

React.js, Angular, and many more frameworks and libraries depend on a **CLI** to get you started.
Angular even get you set up with **TypeScript** _out of the box_.

Of course, you could write React.js without a **bundler**. But if you choose to do so, you would have to **waive JSX**.
And honestly, writing React without JSX is **cumbersome**. Vue **shines** when it comes to such scenarios.

The library can be included with a **CDN** or **downloading the file** on your own — then, import it in your HTML, and
you can start to write Vue.js — _without a CLI and a bundler._

Of course, using Vue like this means getting **rid** of useful _out-of-the-box features_ like **linting**, **TypeScript**, **minimizing**, and more — nevertheless,
I saw people using Vue.js like this. Mainly when integrating the library into an existing project, like a plain JS and HTML app.

Another use case that came to my mind was integrating a front-end library in a site that uses _backend templating_.

## It probably has the flattest learning curve

One of the _arguments_ against **Angular vs. React.js conflict** is the following: _Angular is much harder to learn, React.js is easier to learn._

Since I’m a React.js developer and **barely** know anything about Angular, I don’t want to **judge** it so per se.
What I can judge, however, is the following: _Vue.js has a lower entry-level than the other two._

It’s no coincidence that Vue is often called the **best of both worlds**. While Angular feels much **stricter**,
the **freedom and structure** of React.js can be overwhelming and lead to implementing everything else but _best practices_.
Vue feels like a _combination_ of **both philosophies**.

Every Vue component consists out of three parts:

- A _markup section_, where you can write HTML with Vue’s special template syntax.
- A _section for JavaScript code_, where we define our component under the hood. This includes functions, data, props, and so on.
- A _section for styles_, which can be scoped to one component only.

In my opinion, this is a _clean_ and _easy_ structure for building components.

## Bundle size

I created a **simple app**, _both_ in Angular but as well in React.js. Then I compared the **production bundle sizes**.

The React.js was **135 kb** in size, the same Angular app **145 kb** — only a difference of **10 kb**. So, but what about Vue?

Again, I build the same counter app. Then, I bundled it for production, and it turned out that the Vue app is **93 kb** in size. That’s quite a difference!

Now, let’s come to the next point regarding performance.

## Performance

Actually, I am not a **huge fan** of _comparing_ the **performance of frameworks and libraries**.
Why? Because often, the metrics are quite **worthless** for normal apps.
Nevertheless, I find it interesting to bring in this perspective (and because I know how many people will comment that _Vue’s great performance is missing_).

So, there you go. [Here](https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html) are the results. Please select Vue, Angular, React, and Preact.
I choose to include **Preact** because it is _React’s faster alternative and often a better alternative to plain React_.

Actually, the results **surprised** me. I knew that Vue had a better performance than React and Angular — but
I didn’t expect the difference to be more than slightly. Also, the fact that **Vue outperforms Preact surprised me**.

While Vue **doesn’t dominate** in every benchmark, the **overall performance** is better. We can see this in the last row, called the _geometric mean_.

Nevertheless, you can see under which _circumstances_ the differences actually manifest.
Updating _1m rows_ or _creating 10,000 rows_ isn’t a **typical scenario** in a web app.

## Great tooling out of the box

This is a point that already surprised me about Angular. Angular comes with an **awesome CLI** that supports you for everything you want to do.

Since I mainly work with React, which doesn’t have such a **rich CLI**, I felt really _blessed_ about the **Vue CLI** — it reminds me of the one driving Angular.

With Vue’s official CLI we can do everything:

- Adding tools like _eslint_, _vuex_, or even _apollo_.
- We can add _third-party components_ from NPM.
- We can run a UI **version of the CLI**, which gives us also access to a beautiful webpack analyzer.
- Upgrade projects to a new Vue version.
- Apart from the CLI, there is a larger environment to which we get access. We can easily work with and **configure webpack**,
  build web components and do much more. The Vue CLI can even run single components used for _prototyping_.

Thank you for reading!
