## Overview

In this article, we'll be covering about **Redux Toolkit (RTK)** which will help to us to write **Redux** code a lot _faster_ and _simpler_.
If you loved Redux at first but hated it later after knowning how much boilerplate it required, then _RTK_ is for you.
The concept are same but now most of the work will be handled by _RTK_.

I _assume_ that you're familiar with Redux and it's concepts. I won't be covering about Redux in this article.
Visit [Redux Website](https://Redux.js.org/) to learn about it. Now let's start learning about _RTK_.

## Why use RTK?

Here are some reasons why you should start using _RTK_ now.

### Simple

_RTK_ does most of the things internally. so, it's very simple to use and you can get started within a few minutes.
It simplifies the store setup, creates _actions_ and _reducers_ automatically for us,
handles **immutability** internally using [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) library and much more.

### Powerful

As I already introducted how _RTK_ simplifies the immutability logic internally using [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) library.
It means you could write mutable code now and RTK takes care of immutability for you.

### Productive

The most painful point of Redux used to be the boilerplate it needed to do simple stuff.
But now you can do more work with less code and focus on the core logic of your app needs.

### Opinionated

As you know, to get started in Redux, you need to install atleast 3-4 packages along it.
_RTK_ provides good defaults out of the box and includes the most commonly used Redux addons built-in.
so, it's very opinionated.

## What's Included?

Redux Toolkit includes following libraries by default.

- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) : A Predictable State Container for JS Apps
- [Immer](https://immerjs.github.io/immer/) : A tiny package that allows you to work with immutable state in a more convenient way.
- [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) : A middleware for writing asynchronous logic with Redux.
- [Reselect](https://github.com/reduxjs/reselect) : A simple selector library for Redux.

## Usage Summary

This will be a short usage summary of RTK and I'll show you how easy it is to get started.
We'll be creating a counter app and to make it simple, I'll be using **React** with **JavaScript**.
You could use **TypeScript** as _RTK_ has built-in support for it.

### Install required packages

Add the _RTK_ package and another one called [React-Redux](https://react-redux.js.org/) to your project which would help us to use Redux with React.

```
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
or
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

### Create a Redux store

Import the `configureStore` API from _RTK_. We'll start by creating an empty Redux store, and exporting it.

```js
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {},
})
```

This will automatically configure the **Redux DevTools** extension so that you can inspect the store while developing.

### Provide the Redux store to React

Once the store is configured, we need to pass it to React components using the React-Redux package.
Import the Redux store we just created, put a `<Provider>` around your `<App>`, and pass the store as a prop.

```jsx {3,4,9}
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { store } from './app/store'
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import App from './App'
import './index.css'

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
```

### Create A Redux Slice

Import the `createSlice` API from _RTK_ which uses Immer. Creating a slice needs some default data which are shown in the below example.
The slice generates actions and reducer for you.

```js
import { createSlice } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'

const initialState = {
  value: 0,
}

export const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'counter',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => {
      // RTK allows us to write "mutating" logic in reducers.
      // It doesn't actually mutate the state because it uses the Immer library.
      state.value += 1
    },
    decrement: (state) => {
      state.value -= 1
    },
    incrementByAmount: (state, action) => {
      state.value += action.payload
    },
  },
})

// Action creators are generated for each case reducer function
export const { increment, decrement, incrementByAmount } = counterSlice.actions

// Reducer are generated per slice
export default counterSlice.reducer
```

### Add Generated reducer to the store

Import the reducer function from the slice and add it to your store inside reducer parameter.

```js {2,6}
import { configureStore } from '@reduxjs/toolkit'
import counterReducer from '../features/counter/counterSlice'

export default configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer,
  },
})
```

### Use Redux state and actions in React

Now our React components can use `useSelector` for reading data from store and `useDispatch` to dispatch actions which are imported from React-Redux.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from 'react-redux'
import { decrement, increment } from './counterSlice'

export function Counter() {
  const count = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value)
  const dispatch = useDispatch()

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <button aria-label="Increment value" onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>
          Increment
        </button>
        <span>{count}</span>
        <button aria-label="Decrement value" onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>
          Decrement
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Handling Asynchronous Logic with RTK

_RTK_ provides a `createAsyncThunk()` API for you to write asynchronous code
which uses [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) library underneath the hood.
You can read more about it on their [documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/api/createAsyncThunk).

From **v1.6** of _RTK_, you get an optional package pre-included called **RTK Query (RTKQ)** which is _a powerful data fetching and caching tool_.
It is similar to [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) but specially built on top of Redux and for Redux.
If you want to learn more, visit their [documentation](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview).

## Conclusion

If you're not using _RTK_, now is the time to give it a try.
I'm sure you'll feel more productive after using _RTK_. Hope you liked this article and learned something.
