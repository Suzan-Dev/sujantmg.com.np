## Overview

This article is for people who has worked with JavaScript before and also for those people who wants to learn basic Python.
In this article, I'll be covering fundamental **data types**, **built-in functions and methods**, **variables**, **type conversion** and much more.

But before we start, Let's refresh our knowledge of _programming language_ and why to learn **Python**.

## What is a Programming language?

> According to Wikipedia, a programming language is a formal language comprising a set of strings that produce various kinds of machine code output.

If you got that, then it's awesome. But if you are still confused with the definition, then let me explain to you in simple terms.

> A prgramming language is like a translator which converts your programs that you understand to something that machine understands.

I hope you got that one. It's just a refresh before learning a new programming language. Let's not waste any more time and learn what is Python & why to learn it.

## What is Python programming?

Python is an **interpreted high-level** programming language used for general-purpose software engineering.
Initially developed in the late **1980’s** by [Guido Van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), Python has been around for decades alongside other languages like Java and C.
Van Rossum modeled Python after the English language, eliminating unnecessary syntax to make it easier to read and write than other programming languages.

It is also _open source_, and in recent years has increased in popularity due to its use in **data science**.
Python also has a strong community around **machine learning**, **data modeling**, **data analysis** and **artificial intelligence (AI)**,
with extensive resources and libraries built for these purposes.

And yes, the rumors are true. Python is named after the British comedy group [Monty Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python) which makes it more awesome.

## So why learn Python?

1. Python is extremely versatile, with multiple uses.
2. Python is easy to read, write, and learn.
3. Python is the fastest growing programming language.
4. Python is in high demand for jobs.
5. Python has an incredibly supportive community.

Basically, I wanted to learn Python to be a part of its community and use it for **machine learning** and **building backend servers**. But you shall have your own reasons.
There are much more to why learn Python. You can learn more by researching on your own.

## A Quick Note before learning Python

If you want to code along and already have your **development environment** setup for Python then it's good. Otherwise, We need to install Python on our machine and
setup our development environment which is **out of scope** of this article.

By the way, I'll be using an [online IDE](https://replit.com/) so that I can easily write code without any setup. You can also do the same.
But If you want to write code on your local environment, it's not too difficult to install and there are many articles and videos out there which might help you.

Three things you need to know is that:

1. By installing Python you're installing that **translator** I talked about.
2. After installing Python, I also recommend to install a **Code Editor** or **IDE** to write Python code.
3. If you install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/), you're going to install [CPython](https://github.com/python/cpython).

Now, what the heck is **CPython**?

> CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language
> written in C and Python which is the default and most widely used implementation of the Python language.

If you are confused by this, don't worry. You can skip this and still write code.

I introduced this earlier for you to know what you installed or going to install.
And if you have guessed something, then **YES** you're right. There are other implementation of Python like
[Jython](https://www.jython.org/), [IronPython](https://ironpython.net/) etc.

Finally, from the next topic we are going to learn some Python and do some coding. I hope you're still here so, Let's get started.

## Some Common Data Types

Every programming languages have some common data types like numbers, strings & booleans etc. It allows us to design a data structure for our needs.
Let's learn about them.

### Number

Actually, Python don't have a data type called number like in JavaScript. Instead, there are three distinct type of numbers: _integers_ (**int**),
_floating point numbers_ (**float**) and _complex numbers_ (**complex**). Integers are **whole numbers** and Floats are **numbers containing decimals**.

We won't be covering about complex numbers in this article. Now, let's look at some examples.

```py
# Int
print(3 + 4)
print(2 -1)
print(5 * 5)
print(2 ** 3)
print(7 // 4)
print(7 % 4)

# Float
print(3.5 + 4)
print(2 / 4) # produces a float
```

If you've done some basic maths in school. You could know what we're doing. But I would cover the three operators that are used above.

1. `**` is used to calculate power of the number.
2. `//` is used to get the quotient of the division.
3. `%` is used to get the remainder of the division.

> The `print()` used in above code is a built-in function in Python which just prints the output. There are a lot more built-in functions in Python.
> We can't cover everything Python provides but you could [look at this](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html) when you need the full details
> of the functions and [this](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_functions.asp) if you just want to see the summary of functions.

### String

Strings are **immutable** in Python and are almost similar to JavaScript. Let's look at some examples.

```py
# String can use single or double quotes
print('Hello World')
print("Good Morning")

# For multi-line string
print('''
This
is a
multi-line
string.
''')
```

You can also add strings in Python. This is called **string concatenation**.

```py
print('Hello' + ' ' + 'Sir')
```

**String Concatenation** is great but can be _tedious_ to work with.
If you're a JavaScipt developer then you should have used [Template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
and there is something similar to Python called **Formatted string literals**. This helps us to easily work with dynamic values in strings.

```py
user_name = 'John'
user_age = 32

print(f'Hello {user_name}, You are {user_age} years old.')
```

In the above code, I have used something called **variables** to store the values `'John'` and `32`.
I'll be covering about it so, don't worry.

If you want to use single or double quotes mutiple times in a sentence, then you need to escape it using **escape character** `\`.
`\t` and `\n` are also used in below examples which are **tab space** and **new line** respectively.

```py
print("It's a \"kind of\" sunny day!")
print('\tIt\'s a "kind of" rainy day! \nHope you had a great day.')
```

There are much more to string manipulation in Python. But I think this much enough for _beginners_.

### Boolean

If you're a JavaScipt developer then you must know that, boolean's are capitalized in Python.

```py
print(True)
print(False)

print(2 > 4) # False
print(7 <= 10) # True
print(20 == 20) # True
```

## Variables

**Variable** is a concept that exists on all programming languages. so what does it mean?

> Variable is a mermory location in a computer program where you can store your data.

```py
user_iq = 190
user_age = 190 / 4
```

Let's see some **Best Practices** while creating a variable.

1. Use snake_case for variables name.
2. Start with lowercase/underscore while naming variable.
3. Variable name can contain letters, numbers and underscores.
4. Python is case-sensitive, so diffenrent variables are created if casing is different.
5. Don't overwrite Python keywords like **print**, **int** etc. which you'll learn later.

You can also **rapidly assign** values to the variables.

```py
# 3 new variables are created
a,b,c = 1,2,3
```

## Expressions vs Statements

A piece of code that produces some value is an expression.

```py
# Eg.
print(100 / 5)
```

An entire line of code that perfroms some action is a statement.

```py
# Eg.
user_age = 20
```

## Type Conversion

Previously, I talked about **built-in functions**. Some of them are used to convert the types.

```py
print(type(100))
print(type(str(100)))
print(type(int(str(100))))
```

> `type()` is another built-in function which is used to know the type of a value.

`str()`, `int()`, `bool()`, `set()`, `list()` etc. built-in functions are used to convert one type to another.

## Other Remaining Data Types

### None

The **None** keyword is used to define a **null value**, or **no value** at all. In JavaScipt, it is similar to **null** keyword which simply means _empty_.

### List

It is the **first** _data structure_ out of **fourth** that we're going to learn.

> Data structures are containers that organize and group data according to type.

If you've used **array** in JavaScript then, it is similar and would be easy to learn.

```py
list1 = [1,2,3]
list2 = ['a', 'b', 'c']
list3 = [1, 2.5, 'a', True] # mixed
```

You can access the element you want by using the **index** it corresponds to.

```py
ecommerce_cart = ['Item 1', 'Item 2']
print(ecommerce_cart[0]) # Item 1
print(ecommerce_cart[2]) # IndexError: list index out of range
```

> Remember that, index start from 0 and not 1.

You can **slice** the list to get your desired output using the pattern `[start:stop:step]`. This pattern can also be used with **strings**.

```py
ecommerce_cart = ['laptops', 'desktops', 'mobiles', 'tablets']
print(ecommerce_cart[1:4:2]) # ['desktops', 'tablets']
```

You can also **place** the list within another list to create an **multi-dimensional list** or also known as **matrix**.
It is used in _machine learning_, _image processing_ etc.

```py
matrix = [
	[0,1,2],
	[4,5,6],
	[8,9,[0]]
]

print(matrix[1][2]) # 6
print(matrix[2][2][0]) # 0
```

You can assign list values to the variables easily by **unpacking list**.

```py
a,b,c,*others,d = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
print(a,b,c, others,d) # 1 2 3 [4, 5, 6, 7, 8] 9
```

There are also something called **built-in methods** which are similar to **built-in functions** but they can't be accessed globally.
so, we need to call it using `.` on something. Let's see an example.

```py
my_list = ['a','b']

my_list.append('z')
print(my_list) # ['a', 'b', 'z']

my_list.pop()
print(my_list) # ['a', 'b']
```

I won't be covering **methods** as it'll make this article _too long_. But it is _important_ to know.
So, I'll be providing [link](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_list.asp) for you to learn on your own.

### Dictionary

It is the **second** _data structure_ out of **fourth** in Python.

If you've used **object** in JavaScript then, it is similar and would be easy to learn.

```py
simple_dictionary = {
	'a': 1,
	'b': 2
}

print(simple_dictionary['a']) # 1

complex_dictionary = {
	'a': [1,2,3],
	'b': 'Hello',
	'c': True,
	'd': 7,
	'e': 0.5
}

print(complex_dictionary['a'][2]) # 3
```

Here's a [link](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_dictionary.asp) for dictionary methods.

### Tuple

It is the **third** _data structure_ out of **fourth** in Python.
Tuples are **immutable lists** (i.e. _write_ permission is forbidden and only _read_ access is given).
They are **performant** but **not flexible** than _list_.
So, think before choosing between tuple or list.

```py
my_tuple = (1,2,3,4,5)

my_tuple[3] = 'a' # TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
print(my_tuple[3]) # 4
print(1 in my_tuple) # True
```

> `in` keyword is used to know if the element exists in the data type or not.

Here's a [link](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_tuple.asp) for tuple methods and actually there are only **two**.

### Set

It is the **last** _data structure_ in Python that we're going to learn.
Sets only hold **unique** values.

```py
my_set = {1,2,3,4,5,5}
my_set.add(100)
my_set.add(2)

print(my_set) # {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 100}
print(len(my_set)) # 6
```

> `len()` is a built-in function that is used to calculate length of a data structure and also strings.
> As you know by now, index starts from 0 but you must also know that length starts from 1.

Here's a [link](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_set.asp) for set methods.

If you've read **Set Chapter** in Math class while studying in school then it would be a lot _easier_ to learn this data structure.

## An Advice for Beginners

Every beginners tries to read everything they can before moving on to next things. So, they **memorize** as much as they can. I also did the same.
But I realize after a while that this is really a _bad habit_. I just want to say that you don't need all the information at once.
You can move on to new things by just having some basic idea. And never **hesitate** to say I don't know, if you really don't.
**Don't lie to others and yourself**. Nobody knows everthing and that's why we use _google_ and _other websites_ to help us.
**Thank you** for your time.

## Summary

I think this much is enough for the article. I still haven't covered topics like
**conditional logics**, **loops**, **functions**, **scopes** and much more.
I hope you could learn those basic topics on your own.
See you soon and have a good day.
